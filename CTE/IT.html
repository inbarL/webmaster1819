        AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the
        foundational concepts of computer science and challenges students to
        explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The course
        will allow students to develop computational thinking vital for success
        across multiple disciplines. Students design and implement
        innovative solutions using a process similar to what artists,
        writers, computer scientists, and engineers use to bring ideas to life.
