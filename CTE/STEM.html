(PLTW) INTRO TO ENGINEERING DESIGN      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        This is the
foundation course in a series of Project Lead the Way pre-engineering
courses,  and is designed to introduce  students to the field with emphasis
on the concept of developing a 3-D model or solid rendering of an
object, beginning with hand sketching and advancing to 3-D modeling
software. The course will emphasize the design development process of
a product and how a model of that product is produced, analyzed and
evaluated using a computer-aided design system.

James Martin teaches Introduction to Engineering Design and Engineering Design & Development at Boyd, helping students spark their interest in the engineering fields. He has been an educator for 14 years, with a Bachelor’s in Accounting, and Master’s in both Business & Administration, and Management & Information Sciences. Mr. Martin originally used to teach Microsoft Applications, and stepped into his current role as an engineering teacher since he was good with technology. It all worked out in the end since he is highly proficient with CAD programs, and students of all grades love diving into the projects in his classes.  </div>
