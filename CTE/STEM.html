        (PLTW) INTRO TO ENGINEERING DESIGN (IED)
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        (PLTW) INTRO TO ENGINEERING DESIGN (IED), the
        foundation course in a series of Project Lead the Way pre-engineering
        courses, is designed to introduce the student to the field with emphasis
        on the concept of developing a 3-D model or solid rendering of an
        object, beginning with hand sketching and advancing to 3-D modeling
        software. The course will emphasize the design development process of
        a product, from production to analysis and evaluation. Various design
        applications will be explored with discussion of possible careers.

        (PLTW) ENGINEERING SCIENCE
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        (PLTW) ENGINEERING SCIENCE will guide students toward an
        understanding of the field of engineering and engineering technology
        while developing skills that better prepare them for a rigorous academic
        college curriculum. Applying the principles of various technology
        systems and manufacturing processes helps students learn how
        engineers and technicians use science, technology and math in an
        engineering problem-solving process to benefit people. The course
        includes concerns about social and political consequences of
        technological change.

        (PLTW) DIGITAL ELECTRONICS
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        (PLTW) DIGITAL ELECTRONICS Students will study the application of
        electronic logic circuits and apply Boolean logic to problems. Students will analyze complex
        digital circuitry. Students will design circuits, export their designs to a
        printed circuit auto routing program that generates printed circuit boards
        and construct the design using chips and other components.

        (PLTW) ENGINEERING DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        (PLTW) ENGINEERING DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT Students work in teams to design and develop an
        original solution to a valid open-ended technical problem. Students perform research to choose,
        validate &amp; justify a technical problem. Then, teams design, build &amp; test their solutions while working
        closely with industry professionals who provide mentoring
        opportunities. Finally, student teams present and defend their original
        solution to an outside panel.

      <div class="description">
        ROBOTICS I students will demonstrate knowledge and skills
        necessary for the robotic and automation industry. Through
        implementation of the design process, students will transfer advanced
        academic skills to component designs in a project-based environment.
        Students will build prototypes or use simulation software to test their
        designs for competitive robotic events. Additionally, students explore
        career opportunities, employer expectations, and educational needs in
        the robotic and automation industry.

      <div class="description">
        ROBOTICS II is a project-based course in which students use
        competitive robotic events and apply scientific methods of investigation
        to conduct in-depth research, compile findings, and present their
        findings to an audience that includes experts in the field. To attain
        academic success, students must have opportunities to learn, reinforce,
        apply, and transfer their knowledge, skills, and technologies in a variety
        of settings.<br><br>
