(PLTW) INTRO TO ENGINEERING DESIGN      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        This is the
foundation course in a series of Project Lead the Way pre-engineering
courses,  and is designed to introduce  students to the field with emphasis
on the concept of developing a 3-D model or solid rendering of an
object, beginning with hand sketching and advancing to 3-D modeling
software. The course will emphasize the design development process of
a product and how a model of that product is produced, analyzed and
evaluated using a computer-aided design system.

(PLTW) ENGINEERING SCIENCE      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        This class is part of the Project Lead the
Way pre-engineering sequence and will guide students toward an
understanding of the field of engineering and engineering technology
while developing skills that better prepare them for a rigorous academic
college curriculum. Applying the principles of various technology
systems and manufacturing processes helps students learn how
engineers and technicians use science, technology and math in a problem-solving process to benefit people.

(PLTW) DIGITAL ELECTRONICS      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        Students will study the application of
electronic logic circuits and devices and apply Boolean logic to the
solution of problems. Students will test and analyze simple and complex
digital circuitry. Students will design circuits, export their designs to a
  auto routing program that generates printed circuit boards
and construct it  using various components.

 ENGINEERING DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        In the
Capstone course, students work in teams to design and develop an
original solution to a valid open-ended technical problem by applying
the engineering design process.After carefully defining the
problem and conducting research, teams design, build & test their solutions while working
closely with industry Professionals who provide mentoring
opportunities. Finally, student teams present and defend their original
solution to an outside panel.

ROBOTICS I      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        Students will demonstrate knowledge and skills
necessary for the robotic and automation industry. Through
implementation of the design process, students will transfer advanced
academic skills to component designs in a project-based environment.
Students will build prototypes or use simulation software to test their
designs for competitive robotic events. Additionally, students explore
career opportunities, employer expectations, and educational needs in
the robotic and automation industry.

ROBOTICS II      </div>
      <div class="description" style="background-color:#c45c5c">
        A project-based course in which students use
competitive robotic events and apply scientific methods of investigation
to conduct in-depth research, compile findings, and present their
findings to an audience that includes experts in the field. To attain
academic success, students must have opportunities to learn, reinforce,
apply, and transfer their knowledge, skills, and technologies in a variety
of settings.
