      While McKinney Boyd High School has just over a decade of history to its name, the impact it has had within the community is undeniable. Brought to life by Mary Elizabeth Boyd’s vision, who left a fortune to take care of the students she loved, our school has always been driven to rise above its own expectations. From academics to athletics, we have it all!
<br><br>
McKinney Boyd has the ability offer to its student body many benefits across numerous academic fields; we pride ourselves on providing them with all the tools and skills they’ll need to succeed later in life. With a variety of courses and programs designed to maximize their potential, Boyd truly is the best place for any student to grow into their ideal self.
<br><br>
Boyd boasts a large population of over 3000 students, a number that is ever-growing, but still manages to provide the best quality education for all of them, leaving no student behind. With over 40 classrooms and 10 laboratories, as well as a well-stocked Learning Commons, our academic base is well-covered. In addition, Boyd’s athletic facilities include a baseball field, eight tennis courts, competition and practice gymnasiums, and a training room.
<br><br>
Not only does our school value the academic prowess of the students, but it also seeks to expand their horizons extracurricularly. We have many active clubs and organizations, from the prestigious National Honor Society for community service to the informal Pi Club for math-lovers. No matter where your interests lie, you can find your calling at Boyd.
