      We are Chapter 4371, and we currently have over 20 people in the chapter. Our chapter has been slowly
      growing slowly over the years, and we have members competing in various events. We believe in working hard
      to achieve our goals, and always do out best, even if some might consider it not enough, because the process
      we go through is more important than the reward itself.

          Our History<br>
        </div>
        Mckinney Boyd's Computer Science Club was founded in 2015 by Thai Nguyen and Sammy Shin,
        who were sophomores at the time. Being incredibly talented and interested in computer
        science, they sought to help others learn how to program. The Engineering Club, on the other hand,
        has been a part of student life at Boyd since 2010, and they worked together on projects for
        both TSA and the Living Roof. This year, the two clubs joined forces to help everyone work together on their
        TSA projects, meet new people they can work with, and just see other availabale options
        they can try next time.

        Our Creed<br>
      </div>
      We believe that our education, especially in technological fields, is  critical for our life and our future. We
      believe there is always a need to improve our attitude, work ethic, skills, and the knowledge we hold. We are guided by our teachers,
      other experts we trust, and our own beliefs; we will strive to do our best in improving both our community and the world at large.
      <br>We accept the responsibilities that is placed upon our shoulders. We accept the moral codes that have been
      developed by others in the past. We will explore for safer, more effective methods of working and living.
      We will develop beneficial attitudes and exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through manual and
      intellectual work, we will express our ideas to the best of our abilities to the society around us. We will
      make it our goal to be and do better each day, and to be steadfast in our belief in ourself, and our fellow Americans.

      <img src="../webmaster1819/pics/hour-of-code.png" align="right" width="300">
      We volunteer at the Hour of Code events in schools within our community. This is an oppportunity where we provide
      lessons to those interested in computer science who do not have the resources to get started. We also
      volunteer in the Eddins Elementary Coding Club, where we teach entry and beginner lessons in programming
      to children from third to fifth grade, while helping to tutor kids in other TSA-related subjects, from
      fashion design to debate to architecture to building 3-D models.

      <img src="../webmaster1819/pics/living-roof.png" align="left" width="300">
      Our club has joined in on many different projects to help improve our community. One of them is the Living Roof
      project, where the goal is to help preserve our environment. This project plans a roof that is at least
      partially covered with shrubs, bushes, and even small trees, all of which are planted over a waterproof surface.
      It can also include other layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems to help keep the
      roof functioning. It would be placed above the school roof, and would provide lots of benefits to the students.

      Our chapter's young age means we do not yet have many awards to our name, but we have won a variety  in the
      past, such as the 2017 National Coding Title. Of course, this year, we hope to increase our school's
      collection of awards, and have set our sights on success.
