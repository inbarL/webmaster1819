      We are Chapter 4371, and we currently have over 20 people in the chapter. Our chapter has been slowly
      growing slowly over the years, and we have members competing in various events. We believe in working hard
      to achieve our goals, and always do out best, even if some might consider it not enough, because the process
      we go through is more important than the reward itself.

          Our History<br>
        </div>
        Mckinney Boyd Computer Science began in the year of 2015 by Thai Nguyen and Sammy Shin,
        who were sophomores at the time. Being incredibly talented and interested in computer
        science, they sought to help others learn how to program. The engineering club, on the other hand,
        has been a part of the student life in Mckinney since 2010, and they joined competitions
        like TSA and the Living Roof. This year, they combined to help everyone work together on their
        TSA projects, meet new people they can work with, and just see other availabale options
        they can try next time.
